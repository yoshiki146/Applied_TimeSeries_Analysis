# Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis

    [Pilicy_Effect.R](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/Policy_Effect.R) and [Policy_Effect.ipynb](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/Policy_Effect.ipynb) try to analyse and forecast the monetary policy effect in Japan. The analysis part is based on [Miyao (2002)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270693), which implemented four variable structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that consits of call rate, monetary base, stock price and output. [dataset.zip](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/dataset.zip) contains data of aforementioned variables spanning from 1978:1 to 2017:11. The result is somewhat consistent with the original work in the short run but not consistent in the long run. I assume this is due to the coding error or inadequate preprocessing and I highly appreciate your contribution.   
  
    In the forecasting part, I compared the forecasting performance of four-variable VAR and univariate AR for each series based on mean squared error (MSE). The result showed little difference in their performance, the similar result to [Stock and Watson (2002)](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/073500102317351921), which introduced the utilisation of factors (principal components) to improve the performance. [MonPolicyAnalysis.pdf](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/MonPolicyAnalysis.pdf) gives you more detail
