# Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis [in Japanese]
This is a repository of my work for master's course "Applied Time Series Analysis ([Syllabus](https://kym-syllabus.ofc.kobe-u.ac.jp/kobe_syllabus/2017/44/data/2017_4E607.html))" by Prof. Shibamoto in fourth quarter 2017 at Graduate School of Economics, Kobe University. The topics covered in this course includes ARMA, forecasting, VAR, IV, GMM, unit root, cointegration etc.  

This repository contains the dataset (or path to the dataset) and R code (some in Python) for five assignments and one final project. Assignemts are written in Japanese and final project in English. Below is the details of my final project and brief explanation of the assignments. 
  
[Pilicy_Effect.R](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/Policy_Effect.R) and [Policy_Effect.ipynb](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/Policy_Effect.ipynb) try to analyse and forecast the monetary policy effect in Japan. The analysis part is based on [Miyao (2002)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270693), which implemented four variable structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that consits of call rate, monetary base, stock price and output. [dataset.zip](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/dataset.zip) contains data of aforementioned variables spanning from 1978:1 to 2017:11. The result is somewhat consistent with the original work in the short run but not consistent in the long run. I assume this is due to the coding error or inadequate preprocessing and I highly appreciate your contribution.   
  
In the forecasting part, I compared the forecasting performance of four-variable VAR and univariate AR for each series based on mean squared error (MSE). The result showed little difference in their performance, the similar result to [Stock and Watson (2002)](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/073500102317351921), which introduced the utilisation of factors (principal components) to improve the performance. [MonPolicyAnalysis.pdf](https://github.com/yoshiki146/Applied_TimeSeries_Analysis/blob/master/MonPolicyAnalysis.pdf) gives you more detail
